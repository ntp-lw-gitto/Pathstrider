# Pathstrider

Pathstrider is a conceptual project developed using Lovable, focusing on
user flow, system structure, and interaction logic rather than raw code
implementation.

## What is it?
Pathstrider is a huge whiteboard. That allows users to put data in as much as they want.
Whether it is a PDF file, notes, or a drawing, so users can organize their data/files.
It comes with an AI Assistant allow users to be able to analyze data within the board itself.
Essentially, turning your screentime into a digital working space, rather than a physical one.
